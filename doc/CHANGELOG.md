Changelog
=========

This file follows most, but not all, of the conventions described at
[keepachangelog.com]. Especially we always use [ISO dates]. Subsections or
notations for changes may include Added, Changed, Deprecated, Fixed,
Removed, and Security.

Version numbers are [_major.minor.patch_][semver]. On any change to the
programs or libraries (not the tests), `-current` is appended to the
version number and stays there until the next release, when `-curent` is
removed and the version number is bumped. (Not all releases are tagged, but
specific releases can also be fetched via the Git commit ID.)
