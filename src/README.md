t8dev/src/ Links
================

The symlinks in this directory are merely a more convenient way
for those using this as a submodule to edit the source code
in the two packages: instead of

    vi t8dev/r8format/psrc/binary/…

you can type just

    vi t8dev/src/binary/…

This works only on Unix machines; on Windows (except when specially
configured) these will instead be regular files containing the symlink path.
